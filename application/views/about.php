<h1>About This Site</h1>
<p>This is a really simple image gallery, intended as more than a "hello world" example'
    to be implemented using different MVC frameworks, so they can be compared.</p>
<p>This site started out as the "Simple Gallery" from <a href="http://bryantsmith.com" target="_blank">Bryant Smith</a>.</p>
<h2>The Images</h2>
<p>Images are stored in a "data" folder inside the document root, and they are described in an "images" table, for
    which a SQL script is provided.</p>
<h2>Supporting Technologies</h2>
<p>The website uses the jquery Javascript framework, so that it can also use the jquery lightbox plugin.</p>
<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>This website was created for the Spring 2014 session of ACIT2910, at <a href="http://www.bcit.ca" target="_blank">BCIT</a>.</p>
